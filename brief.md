# TypeScript Game

---

<!-- _class: activity -->

## The task

Congratulations, youâ€™re a TypeScript developer! ðŸ¥³ Now itâ€™s time to show the world your newly discovered powers! <br/><br/>
You need to put everything youâ€™ve learned in both Module 1 and Module 2 to the test by
designing and building your own **full functioning browser based game using HTML, CSS/SCSS and TypeScriptâ€¦**<br/><br/>
You have a few options to choose from depending on your confidence level with TypeScript.
If you are not sure what to choose message a coach and they can always guide you.
Previous trainees have built a wide variety of things, including:

-   Tic Tac Toe
-   Connect Four
-   Point and Shoot games
-   Simple sideways scrolling platform games (e.g. Mario)
-   Snake
-   Minesweeper
-   Quizzes and Trivia (e.g. Who Wants to be a Millionaire)

## Examples

Here are some examples for you from previous students, showing a range of difficulty:

-   [A Quiz Game](https://js-quiz-git-master-jakealistairwood.vercel.app/)
-   [2048 (hard)](https://oliblack.github.io/game-project/)
-   [Hangman](https://manuelare.github.io/hangman-game/#game)
-   [Keyboard Invaders!](https://www.martinharrison.dev/Keyboard-invaders/)
-   [Minesweeper](https://nchomeldoe.github.io/minesweeper-game/)

**Start simple and add new features afterwards!**<br/><br/>
The end goal here is to have your own game that works and also pushes your understanding of TypeScript.

## Letâ€™s build!

Weâ€™re aiming for the following goals for this project:

1. <span class="underline">Create a working Game:</span> The main task is to create a Game not only will this test your understanding of TypeScript but how you break down a problem.
2. <span class="underline">Practice using Git and GitHub flow:</span> We want you to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHub and the command line.

3. <span class="underline">Get a better understanding of how to scope a larger project:</span> We want to see a clear plan of what you're going to build and how.

4. <span class="underline">Apply what you are learning:</span> This is a great place to apply what you have been learning on all of the course so far. When you get it functioning really push on the UI, use SCSS, BEM, anything else you find on the web....really go mad!

## Requirements

<div class='grid'>
<div>

**PSEUDOCODE:**

-   You will need to present a simple plan of your game to one of the coaches, this should include:
    -   a guide on **what** is going to happen in your game in plain english
    -   **how** you are planning on building it
    -   a list of features the game will include, in order of importance

**VERSION CONTROL**

-   You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub.
-   In the repo you will also need a [README.md](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) with a short intro to the project.
-   You must have at least **15 meaningful Git commits** for the project and repo on GitHub, with descriptive names.
</div>

<div>

**READABILITY**

-   Your TS code must be formatted as **functions**
-   Code must be formatted correctly using suitable indentation and variable names.

**THE CODE**

-   **The code must be all your own**, and you should be able to explain what everything does and why it is there. If you canâ€™t explain it, you shouldn't use it.
-   You must use click or keypress events in TypeScript to trigger the events in the game (no refreshing to start the game again!)
-   We would like you to take a mobile-first approach to the implementation. It needs to work on different device widths.

## Here to help

<!-- _class: activity -->

-   **USE THE COACHES:** Itâ€™s extremely normal to need help and guidance here, approaching your first properly open ended task with no guidelines on what functions and tools are needed.
-   You don't have to know everything to start a simple game, all you need are the basics. If you don't know something, you can ask your friend Google. If you can't find a solution there is nothing wrong with that.
-   Add a link to this project on your portfolio â€“ this is your first chance to really show off your web skills!
